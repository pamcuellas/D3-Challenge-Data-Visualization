# D3 - Data Visualization
On this SPA, you can check out a scatter plot implemented with D3 to display correlations among healthcare, age, income, smoke, poverty, and household information grouped by the USA states. It is possible to interact with the chart by clicking the filters on the X and Y axes and by hovering the states circles.
